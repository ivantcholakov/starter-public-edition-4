| DATABASE CONNECTIVITY SETTINGS
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
| This file will contain the settings needed to access your database.
|
| For complete instructions please consult the 'Database Connection'
| page of the User Guide.
|
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
| EXPLANATION OF VARIABLES
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
|
|    ['dsn']      The full DSN string describe a connection to the database.
|    ['hostname'] The hostname of your database server.
|    ['username'] The username used to connect to the database
|    ['password'] The password used to connect to the database
|    ['database'] The name of the database you want to connect to
|    ['dbdriver'] The database driver. e.g.: mysqli.
|                 Currently supported:
|                 cubrid, ibase, mssql, mysql, mysqli, oci8,
|                 odbc, pdo, postgre, sqlite, sqlite3, sqlsrv
|    ['dbprefix'] You can add an optional prefix, which will be added
|                 to the table name when using the  Query Builder class
|    ['pconnect'] TRUE/FALSE - Whether to use a persistent connection
|    ['db_debug'] TRUE/FALSE - Whether database errors should be displayed.
|    ['cache_on'] TRUE/FALSE - Enables/disables query caching
|    ['cachedir'] The path to the folder where cache files should be stored
|    ['char_set'] The character set used in communicating with the database
|    ['dbcollat'] The character collation used in communicating with the database
|                 NOTE: For MySQL and MySQLi databases, this setting is only used
|                  as a backup if your server is running PHP < 5.2.3 or MySQL < 5.0.7
|                 (and in table creation queries made with DB Forge).
|                  There is an incompatibility in PHP with mysql_real_escape_string() which
|                  can make your site vulnerable to SQL injection if you are using a
|                  multi-byte character set and are running versions lower than these.
|                  Sites using Latin-1 or UTF-8 database character set and collation are unaffected.
|    ['swap_pre'] A default table prefix that should be swapped with the dbprefix
|    ['autoinit'] Whether or not to automatically initialize the database.
|    ['encrypt']  Whether or not to use an encrypted connection.
|    ['compress'] Whether or not to use client compression (MySQL only)
|    ['stricton'] TRUE/FALSE - forces 'Strict Mode' connections
|                            - good for ensuring strict SQL while developing
|    ['failover'] array - A array with 0 or more data for connections if the main should fail.
|    ['save_queries'] TRUE/FALSE - Whether to "save" all executed queries.
|                 NOTE: Disabling this will also effectively disable both
|                 $this->db->last_query() and profiling of DB queries.
|                 When you run a query, with this setting set to TRUE (default),
|                 CodeIgniter will store the SQL statement for debugging purposes.
|                 However, this may cause high memory usage, especially if you run
|                 a lot of SQL queries ... disable this to avoid that problem.
|
| The $active_group variable lets you choose which connection group to
| make active.  By default there is only one group (the 'default' group).
|
| The $query_builder variables lets you determine whether or not to load
| the query builder class.
*/
