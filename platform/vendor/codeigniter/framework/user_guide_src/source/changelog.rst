Version 2.0.3
=============

Release Date: August 20, 2011

-  Security

   -  An improvement was made to the MySQL and MySQLi drivers to prevent
      exposing a potential vector for SQL injection on sites using
      multi-byte character sets in the database client connection.
      An incompatibility in PHP versions < 5.2.3 and MySQL < 5.0.7 with
      *mysql_set_charset()* creates a situation where using multi-byte
      character sets on these environments may potentially expose a SQL
      injection attack vector. Latin-1, UTF-8, and other "low ASCII"
      character sets are unaffected on all environments.

      If you are running or considering running a multi-byte character
      set for your database connection, please pay close attention to
      the server environment you are deploying on to ensure you are not
      vulnerable.

-  General Changes

   -  Fixed a bug where there was a misspelling within a code comment in
      the index.php file.
   -  Added Session Class userdata to the output profiler. Additionally,
      added a show/hide toggle on HTTP Headers, Session Data and Config
      Variables.
   -  Removed internal usage of the EXT constant.
   -  Visual updates to the welcome_message view file and default error
      templates. Thanks to `danijelb <https://bitbucket.org/danijelb>`_
      for the pull request.
   -  Added insert_batch() function to the PostgreSQL database driver.
      Thanks to epallerols for the patch.
   -  Added "application/x-csv" to mimes.php.
   -  Fixed a bug where :doc:`Email library <libraries/email>`
      attachments with a "." in the name would using invalid MIME-types.

-  Helpers

   -  Added an optional third parameter to heading() which allows adding
      html attributes to the rendered heading tag.
   -  form_open() now only adds a hidden (Cross-site Reference Forgery)
      protection field when the form's action is internal and is set to
      the post method. (Reactor #165)
   -  Re-worked plural() and singular() functions in the :doc:`Inflector
      helper <helpers/inflector_helper>` to support considerably
      more words.

-  Libraries

   -  Altered Session to use a longer match against the user_agent
      string. See upgrade notes if using database sessions.
   -  Added $this->db->set_dbprefix() to the :doc:`Database
      Driver <database/queries>`.
   -  Changed $this->cart->insert() in the :doc:`Cart
      Library <libraries/cart>` to return the Row ID if a single
      item was inserted successfully.
   -  Added $this->load->get_var() to the :doc:`Loader
      library <libraries/loader>` to retrieve global vars set with
      $this->load->view() and $this->load->vars().
   -  Changed $this->db->having() to insert quotes using escape() rather
      than escape_str().

-------------------

-  Added ENVIRONMENT to reserved constants. (Reactor #196)
-  Changed server check to ensure SCRIPT_NAME is defined. (Reactor #57)
-  Removed APPPATH.'third_party' from the packages autoloader to negate
   needless file stats if no packages exist or if the developer does not
   load any other packages by default.
-  Fixed a bug (Reactor #231) where Sessions Library database table
   example SQL did not contain an index on last_activity. See :doc:`Upgrade
   Notes <installation/upgrade_203>`.
-  Fixed a bug (Reactor #229) where the Sessions Library example SQL in
   the documentation contained incorrect SQL.
-  Fixed a bug (Core #340) where when passing in the second parameter to
   $this->db->select(), column names in subsequent queries would not be
   properly escaped.
-  Fixed issue #199 - Attributes passed as string does not include a
   space between it and the opening tag.
-  Fixed a bug where the method $this->cart->total_items() from :doc:`Cart
   Library <libraries/cart>` now returns the sum of the quantity
   of all items in the cart instead of your total count.
-  Fixed a bug where not setting 'null' when adding fields in db_forge
   for mysql and mysqli drivers would default to NULL instead of NOT
   NULL as the docs suggest.

   $this->db->select_min(), etc could throw notices. Thanks to w43l for
   the patch.

   -  Scaffolding, having been deprecated for a number of versions, has
      been removed.
   -  Plugins have been removed, in favor of Helpers. The CAPTCHA plugin
      has been converted to a Helper and
      :doc:`documented <./helpers/captcha_helper>`. The JavaScript
      calendar plugin was removed due to the ready availability of great
      JavaScript calendars, particularly with jQuery.

      controller sub-directory can be specified when running _GET
      strings instead of URI segments.
   -  Added ability to set "Package" paths - specific paths where the
      Loader and Config classes should try to look first for a requested
      file. This allows distribution of sub-applications with their own
      libraries, models, config files, etc. in a single "package"
      directory. See the :doc:`Loader class <libraries/loader>`
      documentation for more details.

      browser() in the :doc:`User Agent Class <libraries/user_agent>`.
   -  The :doc:`Unit Test Class <libraries/unit_testing>` now has an
      optional "notes" field available to it, and allows for discrete
      display of test result items using
      $this->unit->set_test_items().
   -  Added a $xss_clean class variable to the XMLRPC library, enabling
      control over the use of the Security library's xss_clean()
      method.

      example would contain a zip with "directory" and all of its
      contents.
   -  Added ability in the Image Library to handle PNG transparency for
      resize operations when using the GD lib.
   -  Modified the Session class to prevent use if no encryption key is

Version 1.7
===========

Release Date: October 23, 2008
Hg Tag: 1.7.0

-  Libraries

   -  Added a new :doc:`Form Validation
      Class <libraries/form_validation>`. It simplifies setting
      rules and field names, supports arrays as field names, allows
      groups of validation rules to be saved in a config file, and adds
      some helper functions for use in view files. **Please note that
      the old Validation class is now deprecated**. We will leave it in
      the library folder for some time so that existing applications
      that use it will not break, but you are encouraged to migrate to
      the new version.
   -  Updated the :doc:`Sessions class <libraries/sessions>` so that
      any custom data being saved gets stored to a database rather than
      the session cookie (assuming you are using a database to store
      session data), permitting much more data to be saved.
   -  Added the ability to store libraries in subdirectories within
      either the main "libraries" or the local application "libraries"
      folder. Please see the :doc:`Loader class <libraries/loader>` for
      more info.
   -  Added the ability to assign library objects to your own variable
      names when you use $this->load->library(). Please see the :doc:`Loader
      class <libraries/loader>` for more info.
   -  Added controller class/method info to :doc:`Profiler
      class <general/profiling>` and support for multiple database
      connections.
   -  Improved the "auto typography" feature and moved it out of the
      helper into its own :doc:`Typography
      Class <libraries/typography>`.
   -  Improved performance and accuracy of xss_clean(), including
      reduction of false positives on image/file tests.
   -  Improved :doc:`Parser class <./libraries/parser>` to allow
      multiple calls to the parse() function. The output of each is
      appended in the output.
   -  Added max_filename option to set a file name length limit in the
      :doc:`File Upload Class <libraries/file_uploading>`.
   -  Added set_status_header() function to :doc:`Output
      class <libraries/output>`.
   -  Modified :doc:`Pagination <libraries/pagination>` class to only
      output the "First" link when the link for page one would not be
      shown.
   -  Added support for mb_strlen in the :doc:`Form
      Validation <libraries/form_validation>` class so that
      multi-byte languages will calculate string lengths properly.

-  Database

   -  Improved Active Record class to allow full path column and table
      names: hostname.database.table.column. Also improved the alias
      handling.
   -  Improved how table and column names are escaped and prefixed. It
      now honors full path names when adding prefixes and escaping.
   -  Added Active Record caching feature to "update" and "delete"
      functions.
   -  Added removal of non-printing control characters in escape_str()
      of DB drivers that do not have native PHP escaping mechanisms
      (mssql, oci8, odbc), to avoid potential SQL errors, and possible
      sources of SQL injection.
   -  Added port support to MySQL, MySQLi, and MS SQL database drivers.
   -  Added driver name variable in each DB driver, based on bug report
      #4436.

-  Helpers

   -  Added several new "setting" functions to the :doc:`Form
      helper <helpers/form_helper>` that allow POST data to be
      retrieved and set into forms. These are intended to be used on
      their own, or with the new :doc:`Form Validation
      Class <libraries/form_validation>`.
   -  Added current_url() and uri_segments() to :doc:`URL
      helper <helpers/url_helper>`.
   -  Altered auto_link() in the :doc:`URL
      helper <helpers/url_helper>` so that email addresses with
      "+" included will be linked.
   -  Added meta() function to :doc:`HTML
      helper <helpers/html_helper>`.
   -  Improved accuracy of calculations in :doc:`Number
      helper <helpers/number_helper>`.
   -  Removed added newlines ("\\n") from most form and html helper
      functions.
   -  Tightened up validation in the :doc:`Date
      helper <helpers/date_helper>` function human_to_unix(),
      and eliminated the POSIX regex.
   -  Updated :doc:`Date helper <helpers/date_helper>` to match the
      world's current time zones and offsets.
   -  Modified url_title() in the :doc:`URL
      helper <helpers/url_helper>` to remove characters and digits
      that are part of character entities, to allow dashes, underscores,
      and periods regardless of the $separator, and to allow uppercase
      characters.
   -  Added support for arbitrary attributes in anchor_popup() of the
      :doc:`URL helper <helpers/url_helper>`.

-  Other Changes

   -  Added :doc:`PHP Style Guide <./general/styleguide>` to docs.
   -  Added sanitization in xss_clean() for a deprecated HTML tag that
      could be abused in user input in Internet Explorer.
   -  Added a few openxml document mime types, and an additional mobile
      agent to mimes.php and user_agents.php respectively.
   -  Added a file lock check during caching, before trying to write to
      the file.
   -  Modified Cookie key cleaning to unset a few troublesome key names
      that can be present in certain environments, preventing CI from
      halting execution.
   -  Changed the output of the profiler to use style attribute rather
      than clear, and added the id "codeigniter_profiler" to the
      container div.

Version 1.4.1
=============

Release Date: September 21, 2006

-  Added a new feature that passes URI segments directly to your
   function calls as parameters. See the
   :doc:`Controllers <general/controllers>` page for more info.
-  Added support for a function named _output(), which when used in
   your controllers will received the final rendered output from the
   output class. More info in the :doc:`Controllers <general/controllers>`
   page.
-  Added several new functions in the :doc:`URI
   Class <./libraries/uri>` to let you retrieve and manipulate URI
   segments that have been re-routed using the :doc:`URI
   Routing <general/routing>` feature. Previously, the URI class did not
   permit you to access any re-routed URI segments, but now it does.
-  Added :doc:`$this->output->set_header() <./libraries/output>`
   function, which allows you to set server headers.
-  Updated plugins, helpers, and language classes to allow your
   application folder to contain its own plugins, helpers, and language
   folders. Previously they were always treated as global for your
   entire installation. If your application folder contains any of these
   resources they will be used *instead* the global ones.
-  Added :doc:`Inflector helper <./helpers/inflector_helper>`.
-  Added element() function in the :doc:`array
   helper <./helpers/array_helper>`.
-  Added RAND() to active record orderby() function.
-  Added delete_cookie() and get_cookie() to :doc:`Cookie
   helper <./helpers/cookie_helper>`, even though the input class
   has a cookie fetching function.

   proper error data.
-  Fixed a bug in the email class which was causing it to ignore
   explicitly set alternative headers.
-  Fixed a bug that was causing a PHP error when the Exceptions class
   was called within the get_config() function since it was causing
   problems.
-  Fixed an oversight in the cookie helper in which the config file
   cookie settings were not being honored.
-  Fixed an oversight in the upload class. An item mentioned in the 1.4
   changelog was missing.
-  Added some code to allow email attachments to be reset when sending
   batches of email.
-  Deprecated the application/scripts folder. It will continue to work
   for legacy users, but it is recommended that you create your own
   :doc:`libraries <./general/libraries>` or
   :doc:`models <./general/models>` instead. It was originally added
   before CI had user libraries or models, but it's not needed anymore.
-  Deprecated the $autoload['core'] item from the autoload.php file.
   Instead, please now use: $autoload['libraries']
-  Deprecated the following database functions:
   $this->db->smart_escape_str() and $this->db->fields().

   variables to run queries with. See the Models page for details.
-  Added the ability to pass objects to the :doc:`view loading
   function <./general/views>`: $this->load->view('my_view',
   $object);

-  Redesigned the database libraries to support additional RDBMs
   (Postgres, MySQLi, etc.).
-  Redesigned the :doc:`Active Record class <./database/query_builder>`
   to enable more varied types of queries with simpler syntax, and
   advanced features like JOINs.
-  Added a feature to the database class that lets you run :doc:`custom
   function calls <./database/call_function>`.
-  Added support for :doc:`private functions <general/controllers>` in your
   controllers. Any controller function name that starts with an
   underscore will not be served by a URI request.
-  Added the ability to pass your own initialization parameters to your
   :doc:`custom core libraries <general/creating_libraries>` when using
   $this->load->library()

-  Change the commenting style in the scripts to the PEAR standard so
   that IDEs and tools like phpDocumenter can harvest the comments.

   user developed classes. All CodeIgniter classes are now prefixed with
   CI\_ and all controller methods are prefixed with _ci to avoid
   controller collisions. A list of reserved function names can be
   :doc:`found here <general/controllers>`.
-  Redesigned how the "CI" super object is referenced, depending on
   whether PHP 4 or 5 is being run, since PHP 5 allows a more graceful
   way to manage objects that utilizes a bit less resources.
-  Deprecated: $this->db->use_table() has been deprecated. Please read
   the :doc:`Active Record <./database/query_builder>` page for
   information.

   notable when instantiating classes in your constructors, particularly
   if those classes in turn did work in their constructors.
-  Added a global function named
   :doc:`get_instance() <general/ancillary_classes>` allowing the main
   CodeIgniter object to be accessible throughout your own classes.
